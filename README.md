# StravaMio

## Objective
This project is meant to demonstrate OAuth Strava API connectivity leading to a polished dashboard that highlights datapoints generally ignored by Strava's traditional output. 

At the moment, this workbook is fueled by a CSV download of an athlete's profile and activities. An intitial challenge to overcome stemmed from the inconsistency of region, english/spanish, and timezone data. A decent amount of this exploratory phase was dedicated to cleaning the dataset and ushering it towards a more US-driven output. Additional objects were created including distance by year and actviity type, average speed by activity, and activity trends vs weather.
